# Eye-Tracker-Analysis
Mentor: Libi Kliger (Prof. Galit Yovel) Prof. Galit Yovel's Person Recognition lab experiments with human subjects on topics related to the way we recognize other humans. To answer these questions they use an eye-tracking device, which records the coordinates of the screen pixel that the subject's eye was gazing upon every moment. In a recent experiment, they showed three types of images to subjects and asked them to fixate on a specific point on the screen. However, they can't be sure that subjects did look on that point during all times, and whether specific events occurring on-screen motivated these shifts. The goal of the project is to create a tool that given the raw data and the general experimental design, outputs figures showing a "heatmap" of the gaze of each subject, as well as more quantitave data regarding the correlation of the fixation times to the other things happening on-screen.
